# HashHawk

HashHawk is a versatile Python-based multi-tool designed for ethical purposes, enabling various security assessments and operations. It is equipped with functionalities to perform directory brute-forcing, port scanning, packet analysis, extraction of network information (such as CNAME details), password cracking using hashes, and ZIP file brute-forcing utilizing wordlists to extract contents upon password discovery.

## Features

### Directory Brute Forcing
HashHawk facilitates directory enumeration and brute-forcing, allowing ethical testers to uncover hidden paths and directories within a web server or web application.

### Port Scanning
The tool enables users to perform port scanning to identify open ports and services running on a target system, aiding in network discovery and security assessment.

### Packet Analysis
HashHawk includes packet analysis capabilities to dissect and analyze network packets, providing insights into network traffic, potential vulnerabilities, or suspicious activities.

### Network Information Extraction
It allows the extraction of network information like CNAME details from domains, aiding in understanding domain configurations and potential attack surfaces.

### Password Cracking
The tool supports password cracking using hashes, enabling ethical testers to test the strength of passwords and assess potential vulnerabilities in systems.

### ZIP File Brute Forcing
HashHawk enables users to perform ZIP file brute-forcing using wordlists, attempting to extract contents by systematically trying passwords until a successful match is found.

### Operating Systems
- Linux
- Windows

## Usage

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DwrldDev/HashHawk.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the HashHawk directory:
    ```bash
    cd HashHawk
    ```

3. Install dependencies (if required):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running HashHawk

Usage instructions and command-line arguments for each feature are available within the tool itself. To run HashHawk, use:

```bash
python hashhawk.py
```
### Root/Admin Privileges
For efficient utilization of the Wi-Fi password grabber feature, it's recommended to execute HashHawk with root/admin privileges. This is necessary to access and retrieve sensitive information related to Wi-Fi passwords and network configurations.

You may need to install the requirements when you are root as well

Please note: Ensure you are compliant with local laws and regulations when using HashHawk. Always obtain proper authorization before conducting any security assessments or tests on systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.
